This repository contains my first Homework for the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining course released at the Master Degree in Dtat Science at "Sapienza" University. 
Inside it, you can find: 
* the file "ADM_hw1_ex1.jpynb" with my solutions to the first exercise of the homework;
* the file "ADM_hw1_ex1.jpynb" with my solutions to the second one;
* the file "HackerRank_Submissions" with the print of all my submissions on hackerrank, merged in one .pdf file.

The code in the first two files is organized in cells: each Python cell contains only one exercise, and its first line is a comment consiting of its tiltle on the HackerRank site, while each Markdown cell contains the title of the HackerRank section in which you can find the following exercises.
